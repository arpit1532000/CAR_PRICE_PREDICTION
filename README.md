# Car Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict car prices based on a range of features. The dataset includes various attributes about cars such as make, model, mileage, and year of manufacture, among others. The primary goal is to create a reliable model that can help users estimate the selling price of a car using these features.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:


├── data/                   # Dataset files
├── notebooks/              # Jupyter notebooks used for analysis and modeling
├── models/                 # Saved models for future use
├── README.md               # Project description and details
└── car_price_prediction.ipynb   # Main notebook for EDA, feature engineering, and modeling


### Files:
- **car_price_prediction.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the steps, from exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **data/**: This folder contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **models/**: Pre-trained models saved for deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:
- `make`: The brand of the car.
- `model`: The model of the car.
- `year`: The year the car was manufactured.
- `mileage`: Total mileage driven by the car.
- `price`: The price of the car (target variable).
- Additional features related to the car’s specifications and conditions.

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Converting categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- Feature scaling to normalize the data.

## Modeling

The following machine learning models were explored in this project:
1. **Linear Regression**: A basic regression model to predict car prices.
2. **Random Forest**: A powerful ensemble method used to improve prediction accuracy.
3. **XGBoost**: An advanced gradient boosting technique for better performance.

### Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using metrics like:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared Score

## Results

The final model (Random Forest / XGBoost) provides a prediction accuracy of around X% with the following evaluation metrics:
- **MAE**: X
- **RMSE**: X
- **R-squared**: X
